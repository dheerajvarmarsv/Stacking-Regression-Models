# Stacking Regression Models
 The code is to perform various tasks related to stacking ensemble models for regression
 
 It imports the necessary libraries and packages for data manipulation, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
It installs the "dataprep" and "vecstack" packages using pip.
It mounts the Google Drive to access the input data files and save the output files.
It loads the training and test datasets from CSV files.
It performs some initial data exploration and preprocessing steps, such as dropping unnecessary columns, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
It trains several regression models, including Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Machine Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor, both with default parameters and hyperparameter tuning using randomized search.
It evaluates the trained models using root mean squared error (RMSE) and generates predictions for the test dataset.
It performs stacking of the trained models by combining their predictions as new features and training a meta-model (Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and SVR).
It evaluates the stacked models using RMSE and generates predictions for the test dataset.
It performs hyperparameter tuning for the meta-models (Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and SVR) using grid search.
It evaluates the hyperparameter-tuned meta-models using RMSE and generates predictions for the test dataset.
It calculates and displays the RMSE values for all the models (default and hyperparameter-tuned) and visualizes them using a bar plot.
Note: The code also includes some data visualization and statistical analysis steps using the "dataprep" package, which provides functions for exploratory data analysis (EDA). However, without the input data, it's not possible to provide detailed insights into those steps.
